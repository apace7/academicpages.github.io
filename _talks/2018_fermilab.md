Title: Dwarf Galaxies in the Southern Sky: Dark Matter Annihilation and the Connection to the Large Magellanic Cloud

Abstract: The Î›cold dark matter model successfully explains the distribution of large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background but, there are problems concerning the distribution of dark matter on sub-galactic scales and the open question of the particle nature of dark matter. The Milky Way satellite galaxies are among the most dark matter dominated galaxies and ideal systems to solve the open questions about dark matter. In the past 3 years the number of Milky Way satellites has doubled due to new deep, wide-field imaging instruments. More discoveries than expected have occurred in the southern sky, lead by DECam and the Dark Energy Survey, suggesting a connection to the Large Magellanic Cloud. I will present results of spectroscopic follow-up several of the dwarf galaxy candidates and discuss their dark matter content, metallicities, and potential connections to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The satellite galaxies are excellent targets for dark matter annihilation and I will discuss work on understanding the dark matter flux and the best targets for follow-up.
