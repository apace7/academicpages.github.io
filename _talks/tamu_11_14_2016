Abstract: The Λ cold dark matter (DM) model successfully explains the distribution of
large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background but, there are
several problems concerning the distribution of DM on sub-galactic scales.
In dispersion supported galaxies multiple stellar populations can be utilized
as independent tracers to break modeling degeneracies and infer the mass
slope. I present an analysis searching for multiple stellar populations in a new
Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic data set of the Milky Way satellite galaxy, Ursa
Minor. I identify two chemodynamical stellar populations at high significance
with distinct kinematic, metallicity, and spatial distributions. By utilizing
their dynamics I measure the mass slope and find it is more consistent with a
‘cored’ halo than a ‘cuspy’ halo but systematics prevent a robust measurement.
The self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model provides a mechanism that
modifies the DM distribution on sub-galactic scales. The thermalization due
to self-interactions creates large cores and reduces dark matter densities. I
show fits with SIDM models can explain both the inner and outer regions of
galactic rotation curves. I will comment on an ongoing analysis searching for
velocity gradients (a sign of tidal disruption) in Milky Way satellites in a uniform
manner with quantified significance.
