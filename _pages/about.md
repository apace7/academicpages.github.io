I am a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University.
My interests include Local Group dwarf galaxies, galaxy kinematics, and dark matter (and the intersection of these topics).
I am involved in several Milky Way and near-field cosmology projects including the <span style="color:blue"> [DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey](https://delve-survey.github.io/) </span>, the <span style="color:blue"> [Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey](https://s5collab.github.io/) </span>, the <span style="color:blue"> [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) </span> (Milky Way working group), and The Magellanic Satellites Survey (MagLiteS). 
These projects are searching for new dwarf galaxies and stellar streams or characterizing them with spectroscopy.  
I was a Postdoc and Mitchell Astronomy Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&M University from 2016-2019.  
I completed my graduate work at the University of California-Irvine, working on dynamical models of galaxies under Manoj Kaplinghat.
