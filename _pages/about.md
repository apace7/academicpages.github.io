I am an Postdoc  and Mitchell Astronomy Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&M University.  
My interests include Local Group dwarf galaxies, galaxy kinematics, and dark matter (and the intersection of these topics).
I am a member of the Milky Way working group in the  Dark Energy Survey (DES). 
I completed my graduate work at University of California-Irvine, working on dynamical models of galaxies under Manoj Kaplinghat.
